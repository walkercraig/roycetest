<h4>Website Visitors</h4>

Like most website operators, Craig Walker collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Craig Walker's purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Craig Walker's visitors use its website. From time to time, Craig Walker may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.

Craig Walker also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on walkercraig.com blogs/sites. Craig Walker only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog/site where the comment was left.
